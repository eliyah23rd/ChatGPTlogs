Please improve: Go to the level of pain that is right for you, but not being that.

"Proceed to a level of pain that is challenging but manageable for you, but do not exceed it."

Can you please be more concise and direct in your formulation.

"Challenge yourself but stay within a manageable level of pain."

Can you give it another go: Go to the level of pain that is right for you, but not beyond that.

"Push yourself to a comfortable level of pain, but do not exceed it."

Please improve the following paragraph without making it any longer: There's a part of your brain that drives you to avoid pain at all costs. There's other parts that have long term ambitions for yourself or for the good of the world. Achieving these goals will involve some discomfort or even pain in the short term.

"Your brain has a natural tendency to avoid pain, yet to achieve long-term goals, some discomfort in the short-term may be necessary."
