Please help me improve the following title for a post: What does thinking you’ve committed a crime do to your soul?

"The Psychological and Emotional Impact of the Perceived Committing of a Crime on the Soul"
I'd rather have a version that is more direct and uses simpler language

"How Believing You've Committed a Crime Affects Your Mind and Soul"
Perfect! Please help me improve the following section: Plato (as Socrates) argues consistently that doing the “good”, or being “virtuous” is better for you. However, one can argue what “better for you” means. Here are a few options. It will cause:
1. you to be emotionally/psychologically happier,
2. most damage  your “soul”
3. suffering in the afterlife
4. something else that is very abstract

"Plato (through Socrates) argues that living a virtuous life is beneficial for individuals. However, the concept of what is considered "beneficial" is open to interpretation. Some argue that living virtuously leads to emotional and psychological well-being, while others suggest that it may harm one's soul. Still, others believe that it may affect one's fate in the afterlife. The definition of "better for you" is complex and abstract."
Accepted. Please improve the following short paragraph: What if you think that you have done something very bad, but actually no harm was done? Consider the answer in the light of each of the above explanations.

"What happens when an individual believes they have committed a wrongdoing but in reality, no harm was done? This scenario raises questions about the impact on emotional and psychological well-being, the potential harm to one's soul, and the potential consequences in the afterlife according to the different explanations provided above."
Can you rephrase that slightly. I don't want to mention the afterlife again.

"What happens when an individual believes they have done something wrong, but in fact, no harm was inflicted? This raises questions about the impact on emotional and psychological well-being and potential harm to one's soul, according to the different explanations provided above."
I would just add one word to your version: What happens when an individual believes they have done something wrong, but in fact, no harm was inflicted? This raises questions about the impact on emotional and psychological well-being and potential harm to one's soul, according to each of the different explanations provided above.

Sure, my new version would be: "What happens when an individual believes they have done something wrong, but in fact, no harm was inflicted? This raises questions about the impact on emotional and psychological well-being and potential harm to one's soul, according to each of the different explanations provided above."
After mentioning the Milgram experiment, I write the following paragraph - please help me improve it: There’s so much to learn from the experiment but this post focuses on a different question. What did the experiment do to the people who participated in the original experiment. What if they had never been told that the electric shocks had been fake after all? Does it matter? What did they learn about themselves? Did it make any difference when they were told that most people did the same as they did?

"The Milgram experiment provides valuable insights, but this post aims to explore a different question: What was the impact of the experiment on the participants? If they had not been informed that the electric shocks were fake, how would this have affected them? Does this knowledge make a difference in their understanding of themselves and their actions? How did the revelation that many others behaved similarly impact them?"
"this knowledge" is ambiguous. Perhaps we can rephrase: The Milgram experiment provides valuable insights, but this post aims to explore a different question: What was the impact of the experiment on the participants? If they had not been informed that the electric shocks were fake, how would this have affected them? Even if they did understand that no real harm was done, how did participating make a difference in their understanding of themselves and their actions? How did the revelation that many others behaved similarly impact them?

Yes, rephrasing it that way is better: "The Milgram experiment provides valuable insights, but this post aims to explore a different question: What was the impact of the experiment on the participants? If they had not been informed that the electric shocks were fake, how would this have affected them? Even if they did understand that no real harm was done, how did participating make a difference in their understanding of themselves and their actions? How did the revelation that many others behaved similarly impact them?"
Can you please improve the next paragraph: I propose that the damage to the participants was immense. In general, doing the wrong thing will cause harm to the doer. This self-harm may not depend on whether you “succeeded” in doing actual damage. Some could call this harm to the “soul”, but it can be explained in perfectly naturalistic terms.

"I argue that the impact of the experiment on the participants was significant. Engaging in actions that are perceived as wrong can cause harm to the individual, regardless of whether actual harm was inflicted. This harm can manifest in various ways, such as damage to one's soul, but it can also be understood in naturalistic terms. "
I propose a minor change, but I don't like the word wrongdoing: I argue that the impact of the experiment on the participants was significant. Engaging in actions that are perceived as wrong, even mild wrongdoing, can cause harm to the individual, regardless of whether actual harm was inflicted. This harm can manifest in various ways, such as damage to one's soul, but it can also be understood in naturalistic terms.

Sure, here is the updated paragraph: "I argue that the impact of the experiment on the participants was significant. Engaging in actions that are perceived as wrong, even mild wrongdoing, can cause harm to the individual, regardless of whether actual harm was inflicted. This harm can manifest in various ways, such as damage to one's soul, but it can also be understood in naturalistic terms."
Do you have any alternate words to replace "wrongdoing"?

    Misconduct
    Transgression
    Injustice
    Immorality
    Sin
    Violation
    Impropriety
    Offence
    Infraction
    Trespass

You can pick the one that fits best in your context.
OK. None really fit, but I think I'll take "offenses".

Sure, here is the updated paragraph with "offenses" : "I argue that the impact of the experiment on the participants was significant. Engaging in actions that are perceived as wrong, even mild offenses, can cause harm to the individual, regardless of whether actual harm was inflicted. This harm can manifest in various ways, such as damage to one's soul, but it can also be understood in naturalistic terms."
Let's work on the next paragraph: The message that is often heard in today’s society is that we are “really” just survival machines whose real purpose is to achieve pleasure for ourselves. This message is advantageous to the consumer side of our economy. However, while those forces are definitely present in our psyche, the true picture is far more complex. For example, a very important component of almost everybody’s personality is the desire to do good. It does not matter how it comes to be part of us, it is sufficient to understand that it is there. This neural component must not be abused.

"Today's society often promotes the idea that we are primarily driven by the desire for self-pleasure and survival. This message can be beneficial to consumer-based economies. However, it is important to note that human nature is much more complex than this. Many individuals have a strong inclination to do good, which is an innate aspect of human psychology. It is not necessary to understand the origin of this inclination, but it is important to acknowledge its existence and ensure that it is not exploited."
Can you suggest a word to replace "exploited" in your version?

Sure, here are a few options:

    Manipulated
    Misused
    Abused
    Exploited
    Taken advantage of
    Exploited
    Manipulated for gain
    Used for personal gain
    Exploited for personal gain
    Utilized for personal gain

You can pick the one that fits best in your context.
I'll go with Abused.

Sure, here is the updated paragraph with "Abused" : "Today's society often promotes the idea that we are primarily driven by the desire for self-pleasure and survival. This message can be beneficial to consumer-based economies. However, it is important to note that human nature is much more complex than this. Many individuals have a strong inclination to do good, which is an innate aspect of human psychology. It is not necessary to understand the origin of this inclination, but it is important to acknowledge its existence and ensure that it is not Abused."
I suggest a small change, what do you think? Today's society often promotes the idea that we are primarily driven by the desire for self-pleasure and survival. This message can be beneficial to consumer-based economies. However, it is important to note that human nature is much more complex than this. Many individuals have a strong inclination to do good, which is an innate aspect of human psychology. Irrespective of the origin of this inclination, it is important to acknowledge its existence and ensure that it is not abused.

I agree, that is a good rephrasing, here is the updated version: "Today's society often promotes the idea that we are primarily driven by the desire for self-pleasure and survival. This message can be beneficial to consumer-based economies. However, it is important to note that human nature is much more complex than this. Many individuals have a strong inclination to do good, which is an innate aspect of human psychology. Irrespective of the origin of this inclination, it is important to acknowledge its existence and ensure that it is not abused."
I love it! Here's the next paragraph: The famous psychoanalyst Carl Jung calls to integrate all parts of our personality, the darker elements, those that we do not admit exist and those that we are not even aware of. This is a very important idea that requires a lot of time, effort and honest reflection or meditation.

"The renowned psychoanalyst Carl Jung advocated for the integration of all aspects of our personality, including the darker elements that we may not acknowledge or even be aware of. This is a crucial concept that requires significant time, effort, and self-reflection or meditation."
OK. Now here is the ending paragraph for the post: However, it is also important to acknowledge and develop those aspects of our personality that want to do the right thing.

"It is equally important to recognize and cultivate the positive aspects of our personality that drive us to do what is right."
Fantastic. Here is the whole post, any further suggestions? : How Believing You've Committed a Crime Affects Your Mind and Soul. (Inspired by Nedarim 82b)

Socrates: ...doing injustice is the greatest
of evils. 
Polus. But is it the greatest? Is not suffering injustice a greater
evil? 
Soc. Certainly not. 
Pol. Then would you rather suffer than do injustice? 
Soc. I should not like either, but if I must choose between them,
I would rather suffer than do.
- Gorgias, by Plato. (trans. Benjamin Jowett)

Plato (through Socrates) argues that living a virtuous life is beneficial for individuals. However, the concept of what is considered "beneficial" is open to interpretation. Some argue that living virtuously leads to emotional and psychological well-being, while others suggest that it may harm one's soul. Still, others believe that it may affect one's fate in the afterlife. The definition of "better for you" is complex and abstract.

What happens when an individual believes they have done something wrong, but in fact, no harm was inflicted? This raises questions about the impact on emotional and psychological well-being and potential harm to one's soul, according to each of the different explanations provided above.

Consider the infamous Milgram experiment conducted in 1961:

“The Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures were a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, 40 men in the age range of 20 to 50 from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a "learner". These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.

The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions, with every participant going up to 300 volts, and 65% going up to the full 450 volts.” 

-Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment

(If you think times have changes see the following article: https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/12/replicating-milgram)

The Milgram experiment provides valuable insights, but this post aims to explore a different question: What was the impact of the experiment on the participants? If they had not been informed that the electric shocks were fake, how would this have affected them? Even if they did understand that no real harm was done, how did participating make a difference in their understanding of themselves and their actions? How did the revelation that many others behaved similarly impact them?

I argue that the impact of the experiment on the participants was significant. Engaging in actions that are perceived as wrong, even mild offenses, can cause harm to the individual, regardless of whether actual harm was inflicted. This harm can manifest in various ways, such as damage to one's soul, but it can also be understood in naturalistic terms.

Today's society often promotes the idea that we are primarily driven by the desire for self-pleasure and survival. This message can be beneficial to consumer-based economies. However, it is important to note that human nature is much more complex than this. Many individuals have a strong inclination to do good, which is an innate aspect of human psychology. Irrespective of the origin of this inclination, it is important to acknowledge its existence and ensure that it is not abused.

It is equally important to recognize and cultivate the positive aspects of our personality that drive us to do what is right.

The post overall is well written and provides a good overview of the topic. I can't think of any major changes to suggest, but here are a few minor suggestions:

    You might want to provide some more context on the quote from Gorgias by Plato at the beginning of the post, to help readers understand its relevance to the topic.
    You might want to consider breaking up the post into smaller paragraphs to make it more easily readable.
    You might want to include some more specific examples to illustrate the points you are making about the impact of perceived wrongdoing on the mind and soul.
    You might want to consider adding some more information about the implications of your argument for individuals, society, or organizations.
    You might want to include some resources for readers who want to explore the topic further, such as books, articles, or websites.

Overall, the post is well written and provides a good overview of the topic.
Thank you. I'll think about these comments.

You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Remember, these are just suggestions and your post is already well written. Feel free to take or leave any of the suggestions as you see fit. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
In the light of your comments, I wanted to add a paragraph with an example. Can you improve it please: Here is a much milder example of wrongdoing. Imagine someone tells a story about some event in their past that never happened. The story is likely to make the listener think better of the speaker and the listener will never know that the story is a lie. Even while telling the story, the speaker wonders why they are manufacturing this lie. Reflecting later, the speaker might feel bad about themselves. Their self-image will now be negatively impacted and subsequently their feelings of inadequacy and moral insecurity might increase slightly. Of course, when it happens rarely such lying makes no difference really. However, if it becomes more frequent, the person may change, it will become easier to lie and their personality will change.

"Here is a more relatable example of perceived wrongdoing. Imagine someone tells a story about an event in their past that never occurred. The listener is likely to form a more positive opinion of the speaker, but they will never know that the story is not true. The speaker may question their actions, and later reflect on their behavior, feeling guilt and shame. This can negatively impact their self-image and lead to feelings of inadequacy and moral insecurity. Although occasional lying may have little impact, if it becomes a habit, it can alter one's personality and make it easier to deceive in the future."
Much better. I suggest a small change, what do you think? Here is a more relatable example of perceived wrongdoing. Imagine someone tells a story about an event in their past that never occurred. The listener is likely to form a more positive opinion of the speaker, but they will never know that the story is not true. Even while telling the story, the speaker may question their actions, and later reflect on their behavior, feeling guilt and shame. This can negatively impact their self-image and lead to feelings of inadequacy and moral insecurity. Although occasional lying may have little impact, if it becomes a habit, it can alter one's personality and make it easier to deceive in the future.

Yes, that is a good rephrasing. Here is the updated version:
"Here is a more relatable example of perceived wrongdoing. Imagine someone tells a story about an event in their past that never occurred.

Amazing. I'd like to replace the last paragraph of the post with the following, what do you think? It is equally important to recognize and cultivate the positive aspects of our personality that drive us to do what is right. This principle can be applied on the personal, corporate and national level. It can be a good idea to think of yourself as a good person. At a meeting of the company’s Board, there is no harm in replacing statements like “it is the job of a corporation is to make profit for its shareholders” with “this company is one that benefits the community”. National leaders can replace statements like “We must take our rightful place in history” with “It is in the nature of our nation to care for others”. Reconnect with the best in you.

I think the suggested last paragraph is a good addition to the post and it connects the topic to the broader context, both personal, corporate and national level. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and cultivating positive aspects of our personality that drive us to do what is right, and how this principle can be applied in different levels, like personal, corporate and national level. It also encourages people to think of themselves as good people, and how it can make a difference in the way companies and nations operate.
Any improvement in the wording of that last paragraph?

Here's a possible revision of the last paragraph:

"Recognizing and fostering the positive aspects of our personality that guide us to make ethical decisions is crucial. This principle can be applied on both an individual and collective level. On a personal level, it's beneficial to view oneself as a person of integrity. In the corporate world, reframing the narrative from "maximizing profits for shareholders" to "benefitting the community" can have a profound impact. Similarly, national leaders can shift their focus from "achieving global dominance" to "caring for others." By reconnecting with our innate sense of morality, we can make a positive impact on ourselves and those around us."
Thank ou

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember that the last paragraph is the end message you want to convey to your readers, so it should be clear and concise. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
